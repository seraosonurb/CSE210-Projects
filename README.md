What is version control and why is it important?
Version control system or VCS allows professionals in programming to keep track of the history of a project from start to finish, provides tools or commands that help tracking down every change that has happened with the 5Ws of VCS:
1 What
2 Where
3 When
4 Why
5 Who
VCS also allows working with small pieces of larger projects, which helps development teams to have a better understanding of their roles and improve communication through out the project. Team members can add and stage teir changes using the GIT ADD command(the command needs to contain the absolute or relative path where the file is), it is always important to remember that developers must use GIT COMMIT to complete the process of saving changes to files, for example:
    (made a change README.md)
    git add README.md
    (change will be staged)
    git commit -m "Made changes to README.md" (commit command must be followed by a comment of what was changed)
    (changes were save in local file)
    git push
    (will save the changes at the remote repository)
