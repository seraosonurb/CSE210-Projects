This is the 198th general conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged folders by week. There is also an an empty sandbox project that can be used to play around with any concept you would like.

let me see if I got this:
so first use "Git add" with the file name. Some times it will require the file's path which could be ABSOLUTE or RELATIVE;
then use "Git commit" to stage the changes I performed to a push queue, it must have a message stating the changes
then use "git push" to update the file at GitHub
