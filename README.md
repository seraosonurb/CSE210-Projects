Git allows devs and companies track down the history of a project from start to finish, allowing collaboration through the entire process for anyone that has joined at the beggining, middle or end of the project. It helps setting up expectations for team members, distributing tasks and tracking down which changes were made, who made the changes, when changes where made and where the changes were made.
